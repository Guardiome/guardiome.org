<p>I (Kwat) want this for myself (as a cancer survivor and as a future pediatric oncologist). It&rsquo;s urgent. I don’t think there are people (with my experience + skills) who are capable of doing this well. And I really want to disrupt the cancer status quo.</p>
<h3 id="novelty">Novelty</h3>
<p>Companies in this general space: Cota, Celcuity, Flatiron Health, Foundation Medicine, MedWhat, Predictive Oncology, Proscia, and Tempus.</p>
<p>There is no analytics platform for cancer patients today. And we are going to change that.</p>
<p>Making this works takes life time commitment to the project</p>
<h3 id="heading">$</h3>
<p>We are 100% family owned and in the process of becoming a 501(c)3 entity. Our funding plan is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Now: 100% donations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Later: 20% donations + 40% collaborative research grants + 40% enterprise software service</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="risk">Risk</h3>
<p>Our biggest risks are health data regulations and the temptation to build features that we think are cool but that doctors and patients don&rsquo;t need.</p>
<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>
<p>2015 founded. 2016 YC interviewed (YC didn&rsquo;t like the hardware arm). Dropped hardware. Focused on sequencing and software. 2020 making health analytics as a nonprofit (guardiome.org), and helping people generate private health data (guardiome.com).</p>
<p>We have downloaded and connected almost all publicly available adult and pediatric cancer patient data. The data includes omics like: genomics, epigenetic, transcriptomics, and proteomics. The data also includes clinical metrics like: age, gender, height, weight, blood type, and body mass index. The data also includes socioeconomic metrics like: country, ethnicity, and household income.
We have also started to collaborate with academic institutions to integrate their private patient data.
Integrating all this data, we are modeling each major childhood cancer (blood, central nervous system, muscle, eye, and bone). We have build the model for medulloblastoma. We are collaborating with medulloblastoma experts and physicians to apply the model and get feedback.</p>
<p>Kwat has been crunching numbers for various cancers since 2013. Kwat spent 3 years compiling and connecting cancer data. Kwat has been focussed on this project since 2018.</p>
<h3 id="users">Users</h3>
<p>Oncologists at the UCSD Moores Cancer Center and at the Rady Children&rsquo;s hospital have been using the cancer models to characterize their patients since 2016. Researchers are using our data and models for their projects.</p>
