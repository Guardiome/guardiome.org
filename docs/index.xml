  donations
  grants (collaborate with scientists) help research with osftware analsytics, get two things 1) grant, 2) insights into how to makethings better.
  pay per use of software, charge institutions to plug in their patients.
  in the beginning &amp;gt; mostly donations and grants.
later &amp;gt; scale software to global, goal of system is to include every patient and survivor.</description>

      <description>Problems   There is a massive gap between publicly availble information about a cancer and the information that a clinician uses to make a treatment decision for a patient with that cancer. This gap results in unecessary death.
  Cancer patients are islands &amp;ndash; most people around them can&amp;rsquo;t relate to the extremely unique challenges they face. So they suffer unecessarily due to a lack of knowledge about their situation, which guidence from experienced cancer survivors could easily solve.</description>

      <description>Vision One-Liner Description Health data analytics for childhood cancer patients and survivors.
Short Description We want to build a cancer forecaster &amp;ndash; analytics that help doctors treat patients and that teach patients how to care for themselves better. For example, the cancer forecaster might tell a doctor that in 75% of small cell lung cancers, treatment X killed the cancer but resulted in relapse years later. The cancer forecaster for a patient might remind them that chemotherapy damages the tissue between your joints, so doing instensive exercise while on chemotherapy could cause permanent arthritis.</description>
