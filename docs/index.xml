      <description>Children going through cancer treatment have no immune system. They can quickly die from COVID-19. We urgently need to protect them.
In this project, we will put together their contact information in a directory and assign medical students to check on them.
We will call them periodically, ask about their status, link them with resources, order them food, deliver them stuff, and do whatever we can.
Volunteer (@ Help with COVID)  Reasons to Invest   There is no COVID-19 support group targeting childhood cancer patients.</description>

      <description>About  We make analytics software for childhood cancers.
Our software will help doctors treat children with cancer and help the children engage in their treatment.
Our analytics help doctors characterize childhood cancer, prioritize their treatment, predict their response and track their recovery.
Our analytics help children, understand their disease, learn about their treatment, take their medications, forecast their health, and improve their health after treatment.</description>

      <description>Childhood Cancer Statistics In the US:
Every day, 43 children are diagnosed with cancer.
Childhood cancer affects all gender, ethnic, and socio-economic groups.
The average age of diagnosis is six.
Over 40,000 children get cancer treatment each year.
12% of children with cancer do not survive.
There are 375,000 childhood cancer survivors, which is 1 in 530 adults ages 20-39.
60% of the cancer survivors suffer late-effects like heart failure, infertility, and secondary cancers.</description>

      <description>Motivation I (Kwat) want this for myself (as a cancer survivor and as a future pediatric oncologist). It&amp;rsquo;s urgent. I don’t think there are people (with my experience + skills) who are capable of doing this well. And I really want to disrupt the cancer status quo.
Novelty Companies in this general space: Cota, Celcuity, Flatiron Health, Foundation Medicine, MedWhat, Predictive Oncology, Proscia, and Tempus.
There is no analytics platform for cancer patients today.</description>
