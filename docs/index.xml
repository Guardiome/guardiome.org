      <description>Children going through cancer treatment have no immune system. They can quickly die from COVID-19. We urgently need to protect them.
In this project, we will put together their contact information in a directory and assign medical students to check on them.
We will call them periodically, ask about their status, link them with resources, order them food, deliver them stuff, and do whatever we can.
Volunteer Invest Reasons to Invest   There is no COVID-19 support group targeting childhood cancer patients.</description>

Every day, 43 children are diagnosed with cancer.
Childhood cancer affects all gender, ethnic, and socio-economic groups.
The average age of diagnosis is six.
Over 40,000 children get cancer treatment each year.
12% of children with cancer do not survive.
There are 375,000 childhood cancer survivors, which is 1 in 530 adults ages 20-39.
60% of the cancer survivors suffer late-effects like heart failure, infertility, and secondary cancers.</description>

      <description>Q &amp;amp; A Founder What is your most impressive accomplishment? I went from being a poor nomad in Kazakhstan and cancer survivor to a Stanford MD-PhD student.
A time you most successfully hacked some system to your advantage? I hacked UCSD when I was a sophomore there.
My family are immigrants and were poor. We could not afford the tuition that year. My visa would not let me get any financial assistance.</description>
