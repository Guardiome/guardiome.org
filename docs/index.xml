      <description>Children going through cancer treatment have no immune system. They can quickly die from a COVID-19 infection.
We must protect them.
In this project, we want to put together their contact information and assign medical students to check up on them.
We will call them periodically, ask about their status, link them with resources, order them food, deliver them stuff, and just do whatever we can.
This directory is a vital investment, because we will continuously develop this directory for future disasters and build the national guard for children with cancer.</description>

      <description>About  Mission We make analytics software for childhood cancers.
Our software will help doctors treat children with cancer and help the children engage in their treatment.
Our analytics assist the doctors: 1) characterize children&amp;rsquo;s cancer; 2) prioritize their treatment; 3) predict their response; and 4) track their recovery.
Our anaytics assist the children: 1) understand their disease; 2) learn about their treatment; 3) take their medications; 4) forecast their health; and 5) improve their health after the treatment.</description>
