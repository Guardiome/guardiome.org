<ul>
<li>
<p>There is no COVID-19 support group targeting childhood cancer patients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cofounder had childhood cancer. He is a user, and knows the users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have been building cancer analytics for researchers and oncologists for 7 years. We have the skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have built a profitable whole genome sequencing business. We know how to do startups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This directory is a vital investment because it will become the national guard equivalent for kids with cancer.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
<p>I (Kwat) want this for myself (as a cancer survivor and as a future pediatric oncologist). There are only a few people (with my experience + skills) who are capable of doing this well. And I really want to disrupt the cancer status quo.</p>
<h3 id="novelty">Novelty</h3>
<p>This has not been done because: the market for childhood cancer is small; building this takes long term investment; and it takes someone who went through cancer to have the vision and drive to make it happen.</p>
<h3 id="heading">$</h3>
<p>We are in the process of becoming a 501(c)3 entity. We make money from grants and donations but we do not intend to profit from the Childhood Cancer Directory.</p>
<h3 id="risk">Risk</h3>
<p>Our biggest risks are health data regulations, inconsistent messaging by volunteers, and volunteers failing to followthrough. To succeed, we must: make something that we want; ship fast; and hire slow.</p>
<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>
<p>We made a COVID-19 childhood cancer data sheet. We recruited medical students and got volunteers at <a href="https://helpwithcovid.com/projects/115-childhood-cancer-directory">https://helpwithcovid.com/projects/115-childhood-cancer-directory</a>. We are building the directory web app where patients and volunteers can sign up. Our biggest obstacle is making the app simple yet robust. Responding to users, bugs, and feature requests quickly will be our next challenge.</p>
<h3 id="in-5-years">In 5 years</h3>
<p>All kids with cancer are in the directory. Pediatric cancer clinics tell their patients about the directory. The directory links the kids to scholarships, special summer camps, and more resources. The directory has our analytics, which help the kids understand their disease, learn about their treatment, take their medications, forecast their health, and improve their post-treatment life.</p>
