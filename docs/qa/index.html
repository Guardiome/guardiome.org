<p>I went from being a poor nomad in Kazakhstan and cancer survivor to a Stanford MD-PhD student.</p>
<h3 id="a-time-you-most-successfully-hacked-some-system-to-your-advantage">A time you most successfully hacked some system to your advantage?</h3>
<p>I hacked UCSD when I was a sophomore there.</p>
<p>My family are immigrants and were poor. We could not afford the tuition that year. My visa would not let me get any financial assistance. So I hustled.</p>
<p>I bought a used Ford Expedition for $4000, removed the back seats, and converted it into a minimal living space for $100. I lived in this car for the next 12 months. I spent my days in the library, ate free food at various lab meetings, and worked out and showered at the gym. After midnight, I sneaked into my car to sleep. Repeat.</p>
<p>That year, I took 6 classes per quarter with a grade point average of 3.9. I spent over 1000 hours programming. I saved $12000 on housing, $3000 on food, $500 on transportation, and sold the Expedition for $4500 in the end.</p>
<p>This living system (probably illegal) was a successful hack. I strengthened my academics, skills, health, and mind. And I carried some of my parents&rsquo; financial burden.</p>

<h3 id="why-did-you-pick-this-to-work-on">Why did you pick this to work on?</h3>
<p>I want this for myself (as a cancer survivor and as a future pediatric oncologist). It&rsquo;s urgent. I don’t think there are people (with my experience + skills) who are capable of doing this well. And I really want to disrupt the cancer status quo.</p>
<h3 id="whats-new-about-what-you-plan-to-do">What&rsquo;s new about what you plan to do?</h3>
<p>There is no analytics platform for cancer patients today. And we are going to change that.</p>

<p>2015 founded. 2016 YC interviewed (YC didn&rsquo;t like the hardware arm). Dropped hardware. Focused on sequencing and software. 2020 making health analytics as a nonprofit (guardiome.org), and helping people generate private health data (guardiome.com).</p>
<p>We have downloaded and connected almost all publicly available adult and pediatric cancer patient data. The data includes omics like: genomics, epigenetic, transcriptomics, and proteomics. The data also includes clinical metrics like: age, gender, height, weight, blood type, and body mass index. The data also includes socioeconomic metrics like: country, ethnicity, and household income.
We have also started to collaborate with academic institutions to integrate their private patient data.
Integrating all this data, we are modeling each major childhood cancer (blood, central nervous system, muscle, eye, and bone). We have build the model for medulloblastoma. We are collaborating with medulloblastoma experts and physicians to apply the model and get feedback.</p>
<h3 id="how-long-have-you-been-working-on-this">How long have you been working on this?</h3>
<p>Kwat has been crunching numbers for various cancers since 2013. Kwat spent 3 years compiling and connecting cancer data. Kwat has been focussed on this project since 2018.</p>
<h3 id="active-users">Active Users?</h3>
<p>Oncologists at the UCSD Moores Cancer Center and at the Rady Children&rsquo;s hospital have been using the cancer models to characterize their patients since 2016. Researchers are using our data and models for their projects.</p>
