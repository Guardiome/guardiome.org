            <description>Children going through cancer treatment have no immune system. They can quickly die from a COVID-19 infection.
We must protect them.
In this project, we want to put together their contact information and assign medical students to check up on them.
We will call them periodically, ask about their status, link them with recourses, order them food, deliver them stuff, and just do whatever we can.
This directory is a vital investment, because we will continuously develop this directory for future disasters and build the national guard for children with cancer.</description>
