<p>Health data analytics for childhood cancer patients and survivors.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-your-organization-do">What will your organization do?</h2>
<p>We make open-source analytics software. The software will help doctors take care of kids with cancer.</p>
<ol>
<li>ptu together and organize and make it immediately comsumable: every available cancer data in the world. find everything, download, or standardize public cancer data. compile and standardize all forms of public cancer data.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>integrate data horizontally ucsd ucla, china across institutiosn and vertically same samples diff type. (of course available for the public). the reason 543 companeis allow you to do analytics on the players, anyone can do it, start mock nba plaoff, vbecause the infromation is really clean. if people can do fanatasy football, i want you to be able to do fatasy survial/ cancer analytics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>creating diease models (integrating all levels of data for a patient - height to transcriptome) for medulloblastoma, leukemia (80%) and other child cancers. each model will be a interactive  map of patients. like google maps. topolgy based on cellular cancer states.complex mathematical models reperesented in a simple map. deploy these maps online and enable anybody from anywhere to put their own data (patient, mouse) on the map. THE MAP IS USED TO SUMMARIZE THE DISEASE LANDSCAPE. BE ABLE TO KNOW WHERE A PATIENT IS IN THIS LANDSCAPE &gt; HOW TO TREAT THEM</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using the map to predict probability of importnat events like relapse. inference time. let people map their sample and predict: chemotherapy response, relapse, probablilty of getting other things. make free proabalisitc patient report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>connect patients and doctors to these tools, runt this software at diff institutiions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>run software on cloud</p>
<p>allow clinics/hospital/govs to access this software for free and predict</p>
<p>probabilistic model improves as more people use. positive feedback loop.</p>
<p>as more people connect, as patients get cured, we followup with patients, use oppotunity of regualr psot cnacer checks to followup. social network. this is social network where the doctor will enroll the patiens and the patients will continue using it. personal netflix for health. doctor inistiates, patient keeps account/profile even after cured because continual useful information. analogy &gt; wedding dress this is how the wedding will look for you</p>
<p>real time analytics, with the latest science/data. CANCER FORECAST. two point of view. Doctor&rsquo;s and Patient&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>tailor education for pediatric cancer survivors,</p>
<p>LEARNING ABOUT YOURSELF, LEARN ABOUT SCIENCE BIOLOGY, MICROBIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY, BY LEARNING ABOUT YOURSELF. YOU LEARN MOST WHEN IT MATTERS TO YOU. NOT LEARNING, DOING, HELPING YOURSELF.</p>

<p>100 % donor only, getting feedback and making product better. later when product is really good, hope tumor board people can pay for access. then we&rsquo;ll use that money to improve the software. enterprise cancer forecasting software.</p>
<p>some funds can come from grants.</p>
<p>by colaborating with bench scientists and translational scientists we cna get cut of the grants.</p>

cause this is what i want.</p>
<h2 id="whats-new-about-what-you-plan-to-do">What&rsquo;s new about what you plan to do?</h2>
<p>there are many new things.</p>
<p>theres never been an integrated dataset int he public. beigger than n = 25.</p>
<p>theres never been a comprehensive disease map of these cancers, especially not one that is opent to the public or even user-friendly.</p>
<p>commitment isnt for grants or money. incentive framework is new, create the best cancer forecaster for the next generation of children to use.</p>

<p>other companies are tyring to make short term profit, think of cancer as a business, oppottunity to make profit. theyre either pretending to care about the disease or trying to work on a problem they never had.</p>
<p>practical. other use doctor as consultant and adviros.</p>
<p>here founder = md. i have 14 years of experience as a cancer patient astarting as a patient, someone who has experienced full spectrum of cancer therapy, someone whos been a survior living with consequences of treatment, cancer researcher analyzed more than 1000 cnacer genomes, helped tumor board, now in mdphd prgram at stanford workign on this. this is my disease, my career, and my passion.</p>
<p>to build the tool that patients and doctors will actually use to shape care and improve lives, you cant be a for profit company and you cant be in academia. you need to a a non-profit company driven by an MD cancer survivor.</p>
<p>if your focused on for profit model, you cant collaborate and you priority by definition is profit not solving th patients/doctors problem.</p>
<p>if you are in academia, you are running on the grant hamster wheel, youre forced to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; many small scale problems, left with no time to focus on bigger more meaningful problems.</p>
