## Mission

We make analytics software for childhood cancers.

Our software will help doctors treat children with cancer and help the children engage in their treatment.

Our analytics assist the doctors: 1) characterize children's cancer; 2) prioritize their treatment; 3) predict their response; and 4) track their recovery.

Our anaytics support the children: 1) understand their disease; 2) learn about their treatment; 3) take their medications; 4) forecast their health; and 5) cope with their lives after the treatment.

We commit our life to crafting the smartest childhood cancer analytics.
