# Problems

1. There is a massive gap between publicly availble information about a cancer and the information that a clinician uses to make a treatment decision for a patient with that cancer. This gap results in unecessary death.

2. Cancer patients are islands -- most people around them can't relate to the extremely unique challenges they face. So they suffer unecessarily due to a lack of knowledge about their situation, which guidence from experienced cancer survivors could easily solve.
    * This February I visited a young man who had just received the same cancer diagnosis I received twelve years ago. I told him the things I wish I had and hadn't done. And I told him about the happy family and successful career I was able to create since remission. Everything I told him, he took to heart. He puts my advice in practice everyday. Its likely that conversation changed his life. Why can't we do this for all pediatric cancer patients?
