# Vision

## One-Liner
Health data analytics for childhood cancer patients and survivors.

## Long Term

We make open-source analytics software. The software will help doctors take care of kids with cancer.

1) ptu together and organize and make it immediately comsumable: every available cancer data in the world. find everything, download, or standardize public cancer data. compile and standardize all forms of public cancer data. 

2. integrate data horizontally ucsd ucla, china across institutiosn and vertically same samples diff type. (of course available for the public). the reason 543 companeis allow you to do analytics on the players, anyone can do it, start mock nba plaoff, vbecause the infromation is really clean. if people can do fanatasy football, i want you to be able to do fatasy survial/ cancer analytics. 

3. creating diease models (integrating all levels of data for a patient - height to transcriptome) for medulloblastoma, leukemia (80%) and other child cancers. each model will be a interactive  map of patients. like google maps. topolgy based on cellular cancer states.complex mathematical models reperesented in a simple map. deploy these maps online and enable anybody from anywhere to put their own data (patient, mouse) on the map. THE MAP IS USED TO SUMMARIZE THE DISEASE LANDSCAPE. BE ABLE TO KNOW WHERE A PATIENT IS IN THIS LANDSCAPE > HOW TO TREAT THEM

4. using the map to predict probability of importnat events like relapse. inference time. let people map their sample and predict: chemotherapy response, relapse, probablilty of getting other things. make free proabalisitc patient report.

5. connect patients and doctors to these tools, runt this software at diff institutiions. 

 run software on cloud

allow clinics/hospital/govs to access this software for free and predict

probabilistic model improves as more people use. positive feedback loop. 

as more people connect, as patients get cured, we followup with patients, use oppotunity of regualr psot cnacer checks to followup. social network. this is social network where the doctor will enroll the patiens and the patients will continue using it. personal netflix for health. doctor inistiates, patient keeps account/profile even after cured because continual useful information. analogy > wedding dress this is how the wedding will look for you

real time analytics, with the latest science/data. CANCER FORECAST. two point of view. Doctor's and Patient's.

tailor education for pediatric cancer survivors, 

LEARNING ABOUT YOURSELF, LEARN ABOUT SCIENCE BIOLOGY, MICROBIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY, BY LEARNING ABOUT YOURSELF. YOU LEARN MOST WHEN IT MATTERS TO YOU. NOT LEARNING, DOING, HELPING YOURSELF.
