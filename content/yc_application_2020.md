# Advice From YC

* Be matter of fact > get to the point immediately about your idea, they read 100+ applications a day

* Most important question > what is the most impressive thing the founder has accomplished.

* Show deep insight about the position of your company in its industry

* Bring up the most significant challenges your company will face > awareness of this is good

* Have good alternate ideas > yc goes there if they like you but not your idea

# Writing Notes

* There is context within a piece of text, use that context to avoud redundancy.

* Replace adjectives with numbers, replace comparisions with percentages.

# Organization

## Organization name:
Guardiome


## Organization url, if any:
https://guardiome.org


## If you have a demo, what's the url? Demo can be anything that shows us how the product works. Usually that's a video or screen recording.
(Please don't password protect it; just use an obscure url.)


## Describe your organization in 50 characters or less.
Health data analytics for childhood cancer patients and survivors.


## What will your organization do?
We make open-source analytics software. The software will help doctors take care of kids with cancer.

1) ptu together and organize and make it immediately comsumable: every available cancer data in the world. find everything, download, or standardize public cancer data. compile and standardize all forms of public cancer data. 

2. integrate data horizontally ucsd ucla, china across institutiosn and vertically same samples diff type. (of course available for the public). the reason 543 companeis allow you to do analytics on the players, anyone can do it, start mock nba plaoff, vbecause the infromation is really clean. if people can do fanatasy football, i want you to be able to do fatasy survial/ cancer analytics. 

3. creating diease models (integrating all levels of data for a patient - height to transcriptome) for medulloblastoma, leukemia (80%) and other child cancers. each model will be a interactive  map of patients. like google maps. topolgy based on cellular cancer states.complex mathematical models reperesented in a simple map. deploy these maps online and enable anybody from anywhere to put their own data (patient, mouse) on the map. THE MAP IS USED TO SUMMARIZE THE DISEASE LANDSCAPE. BE ABLE TO KNOW WHERE A PATIENT IS IN THIS LANDSCAPE > HOW TO TREAT THEM

4. using the map to predict probability of importnat events like relapse. inference time. let people map their sample and predict: chemotherapy response, relapse, probablilty of getting other things. make free proabalisitc patient report.

5. connect patients and doctors to these tools, runt this software at diff institutiions. 

 run software on cloud

allow clinics/hospital/govs to access this software for free and predict

probabilistic model improves as more people use. positive feedback loop. 

as more people connect, as patients get cured, we followup with patients, use oppotunity of regualr psot cnacer checks to followup. social network. this is social network where the doctor will enroll the patiens and the patients will continue using it. personal netflix for health. doctor inistiates, patient keeps account/profile even after cured because continual useful information. analogy > wedding dress this is how the wedding will look for you

real time analytics, with the latest science/data. CANCER FORECAST. two point of view. Doctor's and Patient's.

tailor education for pediatric cancer survivors, 

LEARNING ABOUT YOURSELF, LEARN ABOUT SCIENCE BIOLOGY, MICROBIOLOGY, CHEMISTRY, BY LEARNING ABOUT YOURSELF. YOU LEARN MOST WHEN IT MATTERS TO YOU. NOT LEARNING, DOING, HELPING YOURSELF.


## Where do you live now, and where would the organization be based after YC?
Both at Stanford, CA.



## Email address of the founder who is filling out this application:
kwat@stanford.edu

Phone number(s):
3109903458

# Founders

## Please provide the email addresses of the other cofounders in the organization. No need to add yours again.

## Please enter the url of a 1 minute unlisted (not private) YouTube or Youku video introducing the founder(s). This video is an important part of the application. (Follow the Video Guidelines.)

## How many founders are on the team?
1

# Category

## Which category best applies to your organization?
Analytics

# Progress

## How far along are you?
medulloblastoma model plus some predictions done.



## How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time? Please explain.
1. ive been crunching dieases for 5 years. cancer analytics 100 a week since 2015.

2. this speciifc medullosblastoma project has taken 10 months.

## Are people using your product? (yes or no)

## How many active users or customers do you have? If you have some particularly valuable customers, who are they? If you're building hardware, how many units have you shipped?
people on tumor boards of ucsd, radys childrens hospital, and many graduate students and psotdocs. 

data - im going to put on s3 amazon, used and downloaded by many people

model - used by these people plus tumo baords for research purposes onyly.

## Do you have revenue?
No.

## Do you generate direct program revenue or does it comes from donors? If both, what's the split?
100 % donor only, getting feedback and making product better. later when product is really good, hope tumor board people can pay for access. then we'll use that money to improve the software. enterprise cancer forecasting software.

some funds can come from grants.

by colaborating with bench scientists and translational scientists we cna get cut of the grants.

3 sources of income: donor,  grants, enterprise software access. 

## If you've applied previously with the same idea, how much progress have you made since the last time you applied? Anything change?
Havent applied with same idea. APplied with private whoel genome sequencing idea in 2016 and made it to the interview. but kept pivoting, removed hardware, sfotware only, business is self-sustained.


## If you have already participated or committed to participate in an incubator, "accelerator" or "pre-accelerator" program, please tell us about it.
No. No time to waste.


# Idea


## Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise in this area? How do you know this is going to work?
cancer sotry.
cause this is what i want. 


## What's new about what you plan to do?
there are many new things.

theres never been an integrated dataset int he public. beigger than n = 25.

theres never been a comprehensive disease map of these cancers, especially not one that is opent to the public or even user-friendly. 

commitment isnt for grants or money. incentive framework is new, create the best cancer forecaster for the next generation of children to use.

## Who else works in your space, and who might in the future?
Precision Oncology, Cota, Tempus

## What do you understand about your space that other organizations just don't get?
other companies are tyring to make short term profit, think of cancer as a business, oppottunity to make profit. theyre either pretending to care about the disease or trying to work on a problem they never had.

practical. other use doctor as consultant and adviros.

here founder = md. i have 14 years of experience as a cancer patient astarting as a patient, someone who has experienced full spectrum of cancer therapy, someone whos been a survior living with consequences of treatment, cancer researcher analyzed more than 1000 cnacer genomes, helped tumor board, now in mdphd prgram at stanford workign on this. this is my disease, my career, and my passion. 

to build the tool that patients and doctors will actually use to shape care and improve lives, you cant be a for profit company and you cant be in academia. you need to a a non-profit company driven by an MD cancer survivor.

if your focused on for profit model, you cant collaborate and you priority by definition is profit not solving th patients/doctors problem. 

if you are in academia, you are running on the grant hamster wheel, youre forced to "solve" many small scale problems, left with no time to focus on bigger more meaningful problems. 



## How do or will you make money? How much could you make?
(We realize you can't know precisely, but give your best estimate.)
three soruces of income.

1. donations

2. grants (collaborate with scientists) help research with osftware analsytics, get two things 1) grant, 2) insights into how to makethings better. 

3. pay per use of software, charge institutions to plug in their patients.

in the beginning > mostly donations and grants. 

later > scale software to global, goal of system is to include every patient and survivor. charge many people a little bit. amazon of cancer analytics.

annual > 500K-1million  from grant/yr
donation > 500K-1million donation
2000/institution for software license x 1000 institutions in US + 1000 international institutions > 4 million

~10 million revenue from software alone.


# Formation


## Have you incorporated, or formed any legal entity (like an LLC) yet?
Yes.

## What kind of entity and in what state or country was the entity formed?
California LLC. 

## If you're already incorporated, when were you? If you've had funding, how much and from whom?
2015 (using different idea). No funding. THere are angel investors who want to give us money once we get 501c status, application in progress.


## Have you obtained your 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status yet?
No.

## Please provide any other relevant information about the structure or formation of the company.
100% founder owned. Zero debt.

# Legal

## Who writes code, or does other technical work on your product? Was any of it done by a non-founder? Please explain.
No, I write all the code.

# Others

## If you had any other ideas you considered applying with, please list them. One may be something we've been waiting for.

1. predict how the stock price of biotech or pharmaceutical comapny would change based on events in the clinical trial.

2. electronic medical system for MARS. 

3. Refridgerated trash bin divided into compost and regular. The trash can is the least pleasant place in the house, because it stinks and attracts bugs! Why are we living like this? This trash can is refrierated so it doesnt stink, its more sanitary. Also, it allows you to have an indoor compost bin which is good for the environment and your conscience.

4. Super-mommy app (inspired by my wife Kate). A lot of stay at home mom's miss the challenge of work life and they want to feel like they are still building valuable skills that they may one day use in the workplace. This app confronts a stay-at-home mom's unique challange: how to progress as a professional while being a full time mother and wife. This app rejects the following assumption: Stay at home moms have given up developing themselves. They key here is: a little progress at a time adds up, this app helps moms see what they could accomplish over years and celebrates their successes, though they may be small for now.
 
5. Kids books > on graduate level subjects > for adults. Adutls reading them get hgih level understanding of are while having story time with kids.

6. set of earings, rings, and necklace that beeps when you touch your face > purpose is to keep you clean and stop from fidgeting.

7. App to quickly prove that youre STD free.

8. tailored education program to develop future healthcare providers. education curriculum for pediatric patients to become MDs speiclaizing in the field where they were a patient. we want to actually do this as one of the final stages of the cancer forecast network. 



## Please tell us something surprising or amusing that one of you has discovered.
if you really want to knw if youre passionate about something? have a kid and then see if youre motivated enough to do it.

Doing a broad mix of things will make you better in your field of expertise.

most higher education is a excuse to procrastinate creating stuff/value.
