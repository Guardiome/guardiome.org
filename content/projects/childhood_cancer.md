## We want to help kids with cancer.

What happens when a child gets cancer?

(Event 1 kid) **e1k**. A kid gets cancer.

(Event 1 doctor) **e1d**. The kid's doctor must characterize the cancer to plan treatment.

**e2k**. The kid gets the treatment.

**e2d**. The doctor must monitor and adjust the treatment.

The kid may not respond well to or tolerate the treatment, and not make it. When the kid makes it:

**e3k**. The kid gets another cancer.

**e3d**. The doctor must repeat **e1d** if the cancer is new. But if it is a relapse, the doctor must compare the old and the new cancers to strategize more powerful treatment.

**e4k**. The kid does not get another cancer, but suffers from diseases due to the consequences from the cancer treatment.

**e4d**. The doctor must update the cancer treatment protocols to avoid causing the diseass.

**e5k**. The kid lags in education and other social enrichment.

**e5d**. The doctor must keep education support during a treatment regime.
