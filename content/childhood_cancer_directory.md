### The Problem

The feedback loop between kids with cancer and their families expressing a problem they face, and a solution being built that solves that problem, is pathetically slow. Thus, the basic needs of kids with cancer and their families are left unmet. These needs include:
* hospital transportation
* financial support
* lifestyle tips specific to treatment regiment

### Our Solution

We built a low-risk, low-barrier-of-entry directory for kids with cancer and their families at [childhoodcancerdirectory.org](http://childhoodcancerdirectory.org) to sign up. There we can connect with them directly and iterate through the product feedback loop that addresses their most pressing needs faster than anyone else.

### Novelty

This has not been done because: the market for childhood cancer is small; building this takes long term investment; and it takes someone who went through cancer to have the vision and drive to make it happen.

### $

We are 100% family owned and in the process of becoming a 501(c)3 entity. We make money from grants and donations but we do not intend to profit from the Childhood Cancer Directory.

### Risk

Our biggest risks are health data regulations, inconsistent messaging by volunteers, and volunteers failing to followthrough. To succeed, we must: make something that we want; ship fast; and hire slow.

### What's Done

* Built the [Childhood Cancer Directory](http://childhoodcancerdirectory.org) where patients and volunteers can sign up! 

* Recruited volunteers at https://helpwithcovid.com/projects/115-childhood-cancer-directory.

* Signed up Volunteers on the Directory

### What's Next

* Signup Patients on the Directory
     - Tests the assumption that Patients are willing to signup to the Directory using basic information like name and email.

### In 5 years

All kids with cancer are in the directory. Pediatric cancer clinics tell their patients about the directory. The directory links the kids to scholarships, special summer camps, and more resources. The directory has our analytics, which help the kids understand their disease, learn about their treatment, take their medications, forecast their health, and improve their post-treatment life.
