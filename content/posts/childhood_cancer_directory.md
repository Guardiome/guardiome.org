â€‹Children going through cancer treatment have no immune system. They can quickly die from a COVID-19.

We must protect them.

In this project, we want to put together their contact information and assign medical students to check up on them.

We will call them periodically, ask about their status, link them with resources, order them food, deliver them stuff, and just do whatever we can.

This directory is a vital investment, because we will continuously develop it for future disasters and build the national guard for children with cancer.

If you are a medical student and want to help, please contact us.

If you want to support this project, please donate.
