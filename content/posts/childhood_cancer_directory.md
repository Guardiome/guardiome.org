Children going through cancer treatment have no immune system. They can quickly die from COVID-19.

So we must protect them.

In this project, we want to put together their contact information and assign medical students to check on them.

We will call them periodically, ask about their status, link them with resources, order them food, deliver them stuff, and do whatever we can.

This directory is a vital investment because we want it to become the national guard equivalent for kids with cancer.

In a few years we hope:

All kids with cancer are in the directory. Pediatric cancer clinics tell their patients about the directory. The directory links the kids to scholarships, special summer camps, and more resources. The directory has our analytics, which will help the kids understand their disease, learn about their treatment, take their medications, forecast their health, and improve their post-treatment life.

# Childhood Cancer Directory Pitch

Childhood cancer patients have no immune system and can quickly die from COVID-19.

There is no COVID-19 support targeting childhood cancer patients.

Cofounder had childhood cancer. He is a user and knows the users.

We have been crunching numbers for oncologists and building cancer analytics for 7 years. We have the skills.

We have built a profitable whole genome sequencing business. We know how to startup.

This directory is a vital investment. We will help its members with their cancer specific needs, and be ready for a disaster like COVID-19.

We were always panning to build this directory and arm it with our analytics. But building this directory is urgent now, because it can be used immediately to protect kids with cancer from COVID-19.


We were always panning to build this directory and arm it with our analytics. But building this directory is urgent now, because it can be used immediately to protect kids with cancer from COVID-19. This has not been done because: the market for childhood cancer is small; building this takes long term investment; and it takes someone who went through cancer to have the vision and passion to make it happen.


I want this for myself (as a cancer survivor and as a future pediatric oncologist). I donâ€™t think there are people (with my experience + skills) who are capable of doing this well. I really want to disrupt the cancer status quo.
